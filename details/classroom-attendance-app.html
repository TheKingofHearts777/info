        <h2>Classroom Attendance App</h2>
        <p> This project was made using React.js for the <br>
            frontend, Java Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for <br>
            the database, and some Python for the microcontroller <br>
            elements. The main use-case for this app is for <br>
            a classroom setting. There would be an RFID scanner <br>
            located at the entrance to a classroom, and each <br>
            student would have an ID-card to scan on the scanner. <br>
            It would then update our database with the time they <br>
            scanned in, their name, id, current class, and other <br>
            useful information. There is, then, a client side for <br>
            student, teacher, and admin use. The teachers would be <br>
            able to manually enter checkin/checkout times, look at <br>
            their class attendance, and update accordingly. The <br>
            student view is a page with their classes all in a column. <br>
            Clicking one of these classes will send them to another page <br>
            showing them their attendance for the past school year/semester <br>
            in that class and whether they were absent, late, or on time. <br>
            The adminstrator page allows for the assignment of teachers to <br>
            classes, sections, and rooms. It also enables the assignment of <br>
            students to classes, and allows updating of attendance as well.
