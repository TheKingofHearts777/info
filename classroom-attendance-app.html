        <h2>Classroom Attendance App</h2>
        <p> This project was made using React.js for the 
            frontend, Java Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for 
            the database, and some Python for the microcontroller 
            elements. The main use-case for this app is for 
            a classroom setting. There would be an RFID scanner 
            located at the entrance to a classroom, and each 
            student would have an ID-card to scan on the scanner. 
            It would then update our database with the time they 
            scanned in, their name, id, current class, and other 
            useful information. There is, then, a client side for 
            student, teacher, and admin use. The teachers would be 
            able to manually enter checkin/checkout times, look at 
            their class attendance, and update accordingly. The 
            student view is a page with their classes all in a column. 
            Clicking one of these classes will send them to another page 
            showing them their attendance for the past school year/semester 
            in that class and whether they were absent, late, or on time. 
            The adminstrator page allows for the assignment of teachers to 
            classes, sections, and rooms. It also enables the assignment of 
            students to classes, and allows updating of attendance as well.
