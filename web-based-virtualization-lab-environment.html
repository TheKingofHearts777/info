        <h2>Web-based Virtualization Lab Environment</h2>
        <p> This project was my Senior year capstone project at <br>
            college. I mainly worked on the backend server side <br>
            of the project, and helped out some with the database <br>
            which was MongoDB. The project's goal is to create a <br>
            website where CS/Cyber students like myself could <br>
            login to our program, go to their class page and complete <br>
            various labs that their teacher/professor has assigned <br>
            them that day or week. The project spans many disciplines <br>
            including Java backend, Angular JS frontend, VM Networking, Nginx, <br>
            and MongoDB database. We used Proxmox as our VM platform <br>
            which a teammate and I worked with extensively, trying to get the <br>
            VM's showing up in the browser. During out time with this <br>
            project, we weren't able to connect the VM's to the website.
